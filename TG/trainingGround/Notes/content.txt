what to do this comment section is still broke thats what i get for copy paste and not actually designing the feature. 


this is incrediably dificult.


what is real?


what is not?

those are tottally unrelated questions btw i am just curious what a not is i mean i know what a knot is it has real world examples but not the antithis of something or the absence of something.



that is actually dificult to conceptualize. i mean it reminds me of the mind trap and taming the wild memes so they dont consumen my systems and jam up the joint.  jam up the joint 
that reminds me of my early conceptions of how the [redacted] worked and boy oh boy was it silly. 

it peiced togethere a functiong reality in my brain to simulate what i thought it was all about. that reality was dumb as fluff and ofter i got sucked into it i realized that i was going to have to keep writing scripts and jerry rigging sed reality in order to just keep things from collapsing in on themselves.

learned alot

but it was extremly isolating and lonley.




i scared my self the other day.

i belived a story that i told myself about [redacted (is a spice)].

this story may still be true but the situation i found was not what it looked like and (in/under/through) (actuality/the light of logic/the lense of the heart) isnt something to be scared of.

i kinda forgot thats why i was scared.

my friend said in a post he may have been quoting someone else but he said fear of the unknown in imposiable. now this might be  a translation issue because i see the logic behind what he said and it holds  and so on the surface the actuality appears legit but looking with my heart i dont see it that way at all.

so this is going better but not great

July 31
i keep forgetting
who
i
yam
but luckely there are hints in every glance.
some one onece said let there be light
for that i am forever greatful
but in truth this is a story and storties are full of shadows.
it is inescapable. 
much like gravity and apples
. 
we wake up or we dont the alarm keeps going off regardless.

i can only work from the meat machine i find my self in.
this is a story of isims and the reality of reality its self.

i dont know how to do this with out crying.

the only solis i have now is that these are tears of transmutation.

there is so much pain 
there is so much joy
it is all overwhelming

i think that there are some facts that cant be avoided 
regardless of how hard i try.

holding on to onesself in the face of these facts is what makes us who we are .

i guess we need a beginning for a story and honestly i dont know where to begin it all happened in a liner fashion or so im told but it doesent feelthat way.

this is ultimatly a story of [redacted (hint is a spice)] and all of our roles in it.

for the purpose of this story/game/experience i made the [redacted] up because i am allowed to do so. this is my story i am telling.
but it is also yours so i had to find an agreed upon definition for [redacted] and for fucks sake it was near imposiable.
i will edit this later for politness please forgive my swearing.

the only thing that made sense was [not redacted its just to cheesy to say out loud]
and for fuck sake.

i am exhousted.

but i get to do this.

wheather it reaches where it need to is a diffrent matter that is in [redacted]s hands. that is redacted becouse no one seems to agree what that word means.

sure they pretend to but i get the distinct impression everyone is lying.

and i think they lie because of a fundimental something about words and definitions and truth.

gog this is exhousting just thinking these words but i at least have the energy to go forward.

that hasent always been the case.


you know they lied about battery life.

fuck magic

those bastards

nevermind that is a foot note that i am still a little bitter about.

so the thing that ties it all together cant be said i mean sure people say it all the time but the concept is to big.

i mean empires have risen and fallen over it.

i miss [redacted] but im not sure i ever knew [redacted]
i just feel there is a shaped hole that [redacted] should go.

enough sappy ship you want to know where the story begins well due to the nature of [redacted (is a spice)] there are infinate starts. but for the sake of the sory we will start at the first place i saw you. again there is more then one
for fucks sake this is going to take for ever just to get started.

ok i dont know how to do random but its something the internet seems to know something about so i will just start off with the first time i [redacted].

it was the best nap i have ever taken.
honestly if i would have stayed awake i might have missed something.
It was a class in one of my basic comp sci classes. 

fuck i remember and dont that is the most frustrating part of this.

i slept through most of that class.

the waves had yet to start crashing on the shore.

i had missed something.

honestly i had missed alot.

but this particular class was what i needed to make up the diffrence

and i fucking slept through it arghhhhhh.

i mean its in there i feel it 
and i looked on the sylibus later and saw that we were discussing resursion. 
but this was after the test.
which some how i passed by the skin of my teeth.

i was sleeping but my professors words seeped into my dream and the key point stuck. but this isent a comp sci lecture this is supposed to be a story that tells you about what i am making. 

this is a story of E><3 and the infinate potental that is.
that said this is all a bit rambling.
